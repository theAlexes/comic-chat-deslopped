# Making Microsoft Comic Chat DPI-Aware

This document captures everything learned while getting the 1996 Microsoft
Comic Chat MFC client to render correctly on a modern high-DPI Windows
display. It is written for the next person who touches the rendering code, so
it explains *why* the bugs happened, not just *what* changed.

> TL;DR: Comic Chat draws each comic panel into an off-screen DIB and blits it
> to the window. On a high-DPI display the off-screen bitmap was sized from the
> reported DPI (`GetDeviceCaps`) while the on-screen device context actually
> used a *larger* logical→device mapping. `BitBlt` does not scale, so the right
> ~12% of every panel was silently clipped. The fix is to size the bitmap from
> the DC's real `LPtoDP` extent, rebuild it when that extent changes, and blit
> with `StretchBlt` as a safety net.
>
> A second, app-wide issue: only the comic page is drawn in device-independent
> TWIPs. The *other* surfaces (member-list face icons, the bodycam emotion
> wheel) use hardcoded 96-DPI pixel sizes, so once the app became DPI-aware they
> rendered ~33% too small. Those are scaled through a single `DpiScale()` helper
> (see §10).

## 1. Background: how Comic Chat draws

- All drawing coordinates are in **TWIPs** (1440 per inch), defined as
  `UNITSPERINCH` in `common.h`. The view runs in `MM_TWIPS` map mode.
- A comic page is a grid of fixed-size **panels** (`CUnitPanelPage`). The panel
  size is `unitWidth × unitHeight` (TWIPs), recomputed from the client area in
  `CPageView::GetProspectivePanelWidth` / `SetPanelsWide`.
- Each panel is rendered **off-screen** first:
  - `CreateRetainedPanel` (in `pageview.cpp`) allocates a **DIB section**
    (`m_retSec` / `m_retDib`) sized to one panel.
  - `CUnitPanelPage::Draw` (in `panel.cpp`) selects that DIB into a memory DC,
    draws the panel (backdrop, avatars, balloons, title) into it, then
    `BitBlt`s it to the destination DC at the panel's on-screen position.
- Text/title layout is measured with a long-lived cached `CClientDC`
  (`GetClientDC()`), created once in `CPageView::OnCreate`.

The title bar of a comic ("MEET MARKET", "VIRTUALLY VACUOUS", …) is a random
pun pulled from `titles.txt`, rendered with the large `m_fontTitle`. Long puns
are the most visible victims of any horizontal clipping.

## 2. The two DPI concepts that matter here

Windows exposes display scaling in **two** ways, and Comic Chat's code mixes
them up:

| Concept | API | What it returns |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Reported logical DPI** | `GetDeviceCaps(hdc, LOGPIXELSX/Y)` | A nominal number (e.g. `96` or `144`). |
| **Actual mapping scale** | `LPtoDP` on the DC | The real logical→device conversion the DC will use when it draws/blits. |

For a *pure* `MM_TWIPS` DC these agree: `LPtoDP(1440 twips) == LOGPIXELSX`.
But a `CScrollView` (or anything that sets viewport/window extents) can give a
DC an effective scale that **differs from the reported DPI**. In that case
`GetDeviceCaps` lies relative to what the DC actually draws.

**Comic Chat sized its bitmaps from the reported DPI but drew into them with
the actual mapping scale — and those two disagreed on this machine.**

---

## 3. Symptoms observed

On a 144-DPI (150% scaling) laptop display:

1. **Initial run (no DPI awareness):** the whole app was bitmap-stretched by
   Windows' DPI virtualization. Panels were huge and blurry and the comic
   content was clipped.
2. **After `SetProcessDPIAware()`:** UI chrome (menus, dialogs) rendered crisp
   and correctly sized, and *most* of the comic rendered correctly — but the
   right edge of every panel was still clipped. The clearest tell was the
   random title pun: `YOU SHOULDA BEEN THERE` rendered as `YOU SHOULD‑`
   (the "A" sliced off), while shorter lines like `BEEN THERE` were fine.

The clip was always on the **right/bottom** and was roughly a **fixed
percentage** of the panel — a classic "destination bigger than source" blit
symptom, not a font or word-wrap problem.

---

## 4. How it was diagnosed

The app already emits `TRACE(...)` via the MFC/ATL debug channel, which is
visible in **DebugView (DbgView)**. Temporary traces were added at the exact
draw sites and read back live while connected to `irc.libera.chat`:

1. **Title fit** — `CUnitPanelPage::AddTitle`:
   ```
   TITLEFIT 'YOU SHOULDA BEEN THERE' unitWidth=7365 measuredWidth=6511 ... right=6938
   ```
   The wrapped title measured **6938 < unitWidth 7365**, i.e. layout said it
   fit. So it was *not* a measurement/word-wrap bug.

2. **DC agreement** — `CLabel::Draw`: the drawing DC and the cached client DC
   returned identical text extents (`12266 == 12266`). So it was *not* a
   measure-DC vs draw-DC mismatch either.

3. **Bitmap vs panel** — `CUnitPanelPage::Draw`:
   ```
   PANELBLIT bmpW=737 bmpH=737 unitWidth=7365 dcDpiX=144
   ```
   The bitmap was **737px** (= `7365 / 1440 × 144`).

4. **The smoking gun** — per-line device position in `CLabel::Draw`:
   ```
   TITLELINE line=0 width=6511 rightTwip=6938 rightDev=788 bmpW=737 unitWidth=7365
   ```
   The title's right edge maps to **788px**, but the bitmap is only **737px**
   wide. `788 / 6938 × 1440 ≈ 164` → the DC was effectively drawing at ~164 DPI
   while the bitmap was sized for 144 DPI. The last 51px (the "A") fell off the
   edge of the DIB.

5. **Blit positions** confirmed the same scale on the destination side: panel
   #2's logical x `7509` mapped to device `853px` (pure 144-DPI `MM_TWIPS`
   would give `751px`).

So: **bitmap sized at the reported DPI (144 → 737px); content drawn and panels
positioned at the DC's real scale (~164 → 788px). `BitBlt` copies 1:1, so the
extra ~12% is clipped.**

---

## 5. The fixes

All changes are surgical and live in three files.

### 5a. `chat.cpp` — declare DPI awareness
`CChatApp::InitInstance` calls `SetProcessDPIAware()` (resolved dynamically
from `user32.dll`, since the original 1996 target predates it). This stops
Windows from bitmap-stretching the whole window and lets the app render at
native resolution.

```cpp
HMODULE hUser32 = LoadLibrary("user32.dll");
if (hUser32) {
    typedef BOOL (WINAPI *SetProcessDPIAwareFunc)();
    SetProcessDPIAwareFunc setDPIAware =
        (SetProcessDPIAwareFunc)GetProcAddress(hUser32, "SetProcessDPIAware");
    if (setDPIAware) setDPIAware();
    FreeLibrary(hUser32);
}
```

### 5b. `pageview.cpp` — size the bitmap from the DC's real mapping
`CreateRetainedPanel` now derives the DIB pixel size from the DC's actual
`LPtoDP` extent instead of `GetDeviceCaps(LOGPIXELSX/Y)`:

```cpp
POINT pOrg = { 0, 0 };
POINT pExt = { CUnitPanelPage::unitWidth, CUnitPanelPage::unitHeight };
pDC->LPtoDP(&pOrg);
pDC->LPtoDP(&pExt);
infoHdr->biWidth  = abs(pExt.x - pOrg.x);
infoHdr->biHeight = abs(pExt.y - pOrg.y);
```

This guarantees the bitmap is exactly the device size the same DC will draw and
blit a panel at, regardless of whether the reported DPI matches the mapping.
(Two points are transformed and subtracted so any viewport-origin offset
cancels out.)

### 5c. `pageview.cpp` — rebuild the bitmap when the scale/size changes
`CPageView::OnDraw` used to create the retained section once and keep it
forever. Now it checks the existing bitmap's width against what the current
drawing DC needs and rebuilds if they differ (panel size changes, view-mode
switches, DPI/monitor changes, etc.):

```cpp
if (!pDC->IsPrinting()) {
    POINT po = { 0, 0 };
    POINT pe = { CUnitPanelPage::unitWidth, CUnitPanelPage::unitHeight };
    pDC->LPtoDP(&po);
    pDC->LPtoDP(&pe);
    int needW = abs(pe.x - po.x);
    BOOL needNew = (GetRetSec(pDC) == NULL);
    if (!needNew) {
        BITMAP bm;
        ::GetObject(GetRetSec(pDC), sizeof(bm), &bm);
        if (bm.bmWidth != needW) needNew = TRUE;
    }
    if (needNew) {
        FreeRetainedPanelS();
        CreateRetainedPanel(pDC, &m_retSec, &m_retDib);
    }
}
```

### 5d. `panel.cpp` — blit with `StretchBlt` as a safety net
The panel blit was changed from `BitBlt` to `StretchBlt` so that even if a
residual scale mismatch ever remains, the whole panel bitmap is scaled to
exactly fill the panel slot rather than being clipped:

```cpp
dc->SetStretchBltMode(COLORONCOLOR);
dc->StretchBlt(loc2.x, loc2.y, unitWidth, -unitHeight,
               &memDC, 0, 0, unitWidth, -unitHeight, SRCCOPY);
```

With 5b/5c in place the source and destination sizes match, so `StretchBlt`
behaves like a 1:1 copy in the common case; it only kicks in if the scales ever
diverge again.

---

## 6. Why the "obvious" fixes were wrong

- **"Just shrink the title font."** The title already *measured* as fitting
  (`6938 < 7365`). The font was correctly sized; the bitmap was too small.
- **"It's a measurement DC vs drawing DC mismatch."** Traced and ruled out —
  both DCs returned identical text extents.
- **"Force the app DPI-unaware and let Windows stretch it."** That brought back
  uniform blurriness and still clipped in the original (virtualized) run,
  because the clip is inherent to the bitmap-sizing logic, not to the scaling
  mode.

The only correct lever is to make the **off-screen bitmap size** and the
**on-screen mapping scale** agree, which is exactly what `LPtoDP`-based sizing
does.

---

## 7. Gotchas / things to watch

- **`GetDeviceCaps(LOGPIXELSX)` is not the same as the DC's drawing scale.**
  When a view uses scroll/extent-based mapping, prefer `LPtoDP` to learn the
  real conversion.
- **`BitBlt` never scales.** If the source DIB and the destination logical rect
  imply different device sizes, content is clipped (or garbage is read past the
  end of the source). Use `StretchBlt` when you cannot guarantee equal scales.
- **Long-lived cached DCs** (`GetClientDC()` created in `OnCreate`) can capture
  a stale mapping. If display DPI/monitor changes at runtime, anything sized
  from that cached DC may be wrong. The `OnDraw` size-check (5c) mitigates this
  for the panel bitmap.
- **This is system-DPI awareness, not per-monitor.** `SetProcessDPIAware()`
  fixes the single-display case. Moving the window between monitors of
  different DPI is out of scope; per-monitor v2 awareness would require a
  manifest and `WM_DPICHANGED` handling.
- **TWIPs everywhere.** Keep new drawing code in `MM_TWIPS` and reason about
  device pixels only via `LPtoDP`/`DPtoLP`.

## 8. How to verify

1. Build: `nmake /f chat.mak CFG="chat - Win32 Debug"` (see the repo README /
   build notes; ATLMFC spectre libs and `uuid.lib` are required).
2. Run `chat.exe` on a high-DPI display (e.g. 150% scaling).
3. Connect to `irc.libera.chat` (plaintext port 6667 — see note below) and join
   a busy channel so a title/cast panel is generated.
4. Confirm the random title pun renders **in full** (no clipped final letter)
   and that balloons/avatars reach the panel's right edge without being cut.
5. Confirm the **pixel-based surfaces** are sized proportionally to the comic
   (see §10): the member-list face icons (upper right), the avatar preview, and
   the bodycam **emotion wheel** with its 8 face icons (lower right).
6. Optional: attach DebugView and confirm there are no panel clip anomalies.

**Verified:** built clean and run end-to-end on a 144-DPI (150%) display —
connected to Libera (`###bots`), comic view rendered with the title
"YOU SHOULDA BEEN THERE" uncut, correctly-sized member-list faces, a crisp
avatar preview, and a properly-scaled emotion wheel. Standard-DPI (96/100%) is
unaffected because `DpiScale(n) == n` there.

---

## 9. Related, non-DPI notes discovered alongside this work

- **No TLS.** Comic Chat speaks plaintext IRC over `CSocket`; it cannot connect
  to TLS-only ports such as `6697`. Use a local `stunnel`/ZNC bridge if a
  network requires TLS, and point Comic Chat at the local plaintext endpoint.
- **Room-join assertion.** Joining a channel called `SetPathName(channel)`,
  which modern MFC pushes onto the MRU file list, asserting on the non-file
  name. Passing `FALSE` (`SetPathName(channel, FALSE)`) skips the MRU add.
- **Missing TTS wrapper.** `chat.exe` imported `initproc`/`ttsproc`/`exitproc`
  from `lhwrap.dll`, a wrapper around the Lernout & Hauspie text-to-speech
  engine (1996). That DLL is absent, so these are stubbed; speech is a no-op.

## 10. App-wide scaling of pixel-based surfaces

Fixing the comic page (§5) is necessary but **not sufficient**. The comic page
is the only surface drawn in TWIPs; the rest of the UI uses hardcoded device
pixels tuned for 96 DPI. Once the process became DPI-aware, those surfaces
stopped being bitmap-stretched by Windows and rendered at their literal pixel
sizes — i.e. ~33% too small on a 144-DPI (150%) display. The visible symptoms
were the **member-list face icons** (upper right) and the **bodycam emotion
wheel** (lower right) looking tiny next to a correctly-sized comic.

### Why not just let Windows scale the whole app?
We tried the obvious "uniform" answers and rejected them:

- **DPI virtualization (unaware):** bitmap-stretches everything uniformly, but
  blurry, and it still hit the comic-bitmap clipping bug.
- **GDI Scaling** (`gdiScaling=true` + `dpiUnaware`): re-renders GDI crisply,
  but Comic Chat persists its window geometry in raw pixels. Geometry saved
  during a DPI-*aware* session got re-scaled by the OS, so the **main window
  opened gigantic**. The OS-scaling model fights the app's custom pixel layout.

So we keep true DPI awareness (comic + window geometry are correct) and scale
the pixel surfaces ourselves.

### The helper
`common.h` exposes one tiny helper, initialized once in
`CChatApp::InitInstance`:

```cpp
extern int g_screenDpi;                                  // = GetDeviceCaps(LOGPIXELSX)
inline int DpiScale(int n96) { return ::MulDiv(n96, g_screenDpi, 96); }
```

At 96 DPI `DpiScale(n) == n`, so **standard-DPI users see no change** — this is
purely additive for high-DPI displays.

### Where it's applied
- **Member list (`memblst.cpp`, `irc.cpp`):** the list-view image list is created
  at `DpiScale(40)` cells, and `AddToImageList` `StretchBlt`s each face bitmap up
  by the same factor (the source art is fixed ~96-DPI pixel art, so it must be
  enlarged or it renders tiny in a big cell).
- **Bodycam emotion wheel (`bodycam.cpp`):** `CacheBullSide` caps the wheel at
  `DpiScale(MAXBULL)` / `DpiScale(MINBULL)`; the shared icon metrics
  (`m_iconWidth`, `m_iconHeight`, `m_cursorRadius`) are scaled once in the
  constructor; and the emotion face icons are drawn with the stretching
  `CDIB::Draw(dc,x,y,w,h)` overload to fill the scaled slots.
- **Say box + action buttons (`chat.cpp`, `saywnd.cpp`, `spltchat.cpp`):** the
  input-edit font (`m_fontText`, `nFontHeight`) is created at `-DpiScale(14)`;
  the Say-window layout (edit height, bar position) in `CSayWnd::OnSize` uses
  `DpiScale(cxSayBar/cyToolBar)`; the Say pane's minimum height
  (`nPixelsSayMin`) is `DpiScale(23)` so the bigger text isn't clipped; and the
  four action-balloon toolbar buttons are enlarged by stretching `IDB_BALLOONS`
  into a `DpiScale`-sized image list assigned to the toolbar control (high-DPI
  only — a no-op at 96).

### Gotchas / follow-ups
- Stretching small pixel art with `COLORONCOLOR` is slightly blocky but matches
  the in-panel comic avatars (which stretch the same art) and is far better than
  tiny. `HALFTONE` would be smoother at a small perf cost.
- The bodycam wheel is still capped by its splitter pane's pixel width; it's wide
  enough at normal window sizes, but a very narrow right column will clamp it.

---

## 11. UX polish pass (scroll wheel + panel auto-fit)

Two non-DPI usability fixes shipped alongside the scaling work:

- **Mouse-wheel scrolling (`pageview.cpp`).** `CPageView` (a `CScrollView`) had no
  wheel handler, so the comic area never scrolled by wheel. Added
  `OnMouseWheel`, which scrolls via `OnScrollBy(CSize(0, -notches*DpiScale(48)))`.
  Relies on the cursor's window receiving `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` (focused window, or the
  hovered one with Windows' "scroll inactive windows" setting, which is on by
  default).
- **Panels-per-row auto-fit (`pageview.cpp`).** The column count was a fixed,
  registry-persisted value (usually 2), so wide windows wasted space. Added
  `FitPanelsWide()` — the largest column count (1..5) whose panels stay a
  comfortable width (`COMFORTABLEPANELWIDTH` twips) — and apply it when the view
  activates and on resize.

  **Important implementation detail:** `SetPanelsWide()` reloads the comic
  history and updates scroll info, which re-enters `WM_SIZE`. Calling it directly
  from `OnSize`/`OnActivateView` crashed (re-entrancy). The fix is to **defer**
  the reflow with `PostMessage(WM_AUTOFITPANELS)` and run it from the posted
  handler in a stable state, guarded by `m_bAutoFitting` and an idempotent
  "only if the count actually changed" check.
- **Word wrap inside balloons (`balloon.cpp`).** `BreakIntoLines` used to
  `ForceLineBreak` (split mid-character) when a single word was wider than the
  balloon's estimated text area — so in a narrow balloon a short word like
  "Test" became "Tes" / "t". Since the balloon spline is built from the actual
  line widths, the right behavior is to keep the word whole and let the balloon
  grow; `BreakIntoLines` now does that instead of splitting the word. (This is a
  bubble-internal layout fix, independent of panel width — narrow panels just
  made it surface more often.)
