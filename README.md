# Microsoft Comic Chat

Microsoft Comic Chat is a Microsoft-developed IRC chat client released in 1996 that rendered conversations as automatically generated comic strips. Instead of plain text, users communicated through cartoon avatars with messages displayed in speech bubbles inside dynamically composed comic panels. The application used an expert system to determine character placement, gestures, facial expressions, balloon shape, and panel layout in real time. It shipped as part of Internet Explorer 3.0 and was later bundled with Windows 98 and MSN before being discontinued in the early 2000s.

## How It Works

As users type messages, each Comic Chat client automatically determines:

- Which characters to place in each panel
- Gestures and facial expressions based on message content
- Character placement and orientation
- Word balloon shape, outline, and layout
- When to advance to a new panel
- Zoom factor for each panel

The application connects to standard IRC servers and is fully interoperable with text-based IRC clients. Non-Comic Chat users are automatically assigned characters so the entire conversation is rendered graphically.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains source snapshots spanning the full development history of Comic Chat, from a 1996 pre-release through the 2.5 beta. It also includes two **`*-modern`** folders — worked examples that get the original code building and running on a current Windows machine (see [the note on the modernized folders](#a-note-on-the-modernized-folders) for what they are and why they exist).

### Version notes

- **v1.0-pre** and **v1.0** share the same internal version number (`rup 206, "Beta 2"`) but differ in ~99 of 111 shared source files. `v1.0` adds build infrastructure (`build/`, `help/`, `setup/`, `shared/`).
- **v2.1b** and **v2.5-beta-1** include an IRC protocol layer with multi-server support, OLE automation for scripting, and the Art Pack 1 character set in addition to the original characters.
- **artifacts/** contains the Comic Chat SDK, JChat (a Java client), the Betty Bot sample, xcchat, and internal design documents.

## Building

### Original build (Visual C++ 4.x)

All versions target Win32 (x86) using Visual C++ 4.x with MFC and NMAKE makefiles.

**v1.0-pre and v1.0:**
```batch
cd v1.0/client
NMAKE /f "chat.mak" CFG="chat - Win32 Release"
```

**v2.5-beta-1:**
```batch
cd v2.5-beta-1
NMAKE /f "chat.mak" CFG="chat - Win32 Release"
```

A `.mdp` (Visual C++ 4.x) project file is included in `v1.0-pre/client/` and `v1.0/client/` for IDE use.

### Modernized build (Visual Studio 2022)

`v1.0-pre-modern/` builds with a current Visual Studio C++/MFC toolchain and runs on modern high-DPI Windows:

```bat
call "<VisualStudio>\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars32.bat"
cd v1.0-pre-modern
nmake /f chat.mak CFG="chat - Win32 Debug"
```

The modernization covers build fixes (legacy C++, MFC/OLE macro clashes, linker libs), **DPI-aware rendering and UI scaling**, several **UX fixes** (mouse-wheel scrolling, panels-per-row auto-fit, balloon word-wrap), and optional **native TLS** for connecting to modern IRC networks. See [`docs/MODERNIZATION.md`](docs/MODERNIZATION.md) for details.

`v2.5-beta-1-modern/` brings the more advanced **Comic Chat 2.5 beta-1** (June 1998) client — which originally built with the Windows NT DDK `BUILD.EXE` system — up on the modern toolchain with its own clean `nmake` makefile:

```bat
call "<VisualStudio>\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars32.bat"
cd v2.5-beta-1-modern
nmake /f chat.mak CFG="chat - Win32 Release"    REM everyday use
nmake /f chat.mak CFG="chat - Win32 Debug"      REM asserts + TRACE for DebugView
```

It carries the mouse-wheel and panels-per-row work across and runs **DPI-unaware** so Windows scales the whole window uniformly (rather than scaling a few surfaces and leaving the rest tiny). The chief 2.5-specific fixes were dropping the MFC-4.0 common-control struct-tag remap, adding a Common Controls v6 manifest so the rebar toolbar creates, and the runtime fixes needed to connect/join/chat on a present-day IRC network. See [`v2.5-beta-1-modern/README.md`](v2.5-beta-1-modern/README.md).

### A note on the modernized folders

This repository is published primarily as a **historical artifact** — the source is here for reference, study, and preservation, not as a maintained product. The `*-modern` folders are **not** a polished re-release; they're **worked examples** of the kinds of changes it takes to get a 1996–1998 MFC application building and running on a current machine, such as:

- Getting it to **build with a current Visual Studio / MFC toolchain** on a normal developer machine (the original Visual C++ 4.x and NT DDK `BUILD.EXE` systems are long gone).
- **Uniform display scaling** so the window and its controls are legible on today's high-DPI monitors.
- A handful of modern-Windows compatibility fixes — Common Controls v6 for the toolbar, modern RichEdit/CRT behavior, IRC parsing that works with present-day servers, and short-circuiting the long-dead Microsoft art-download servers in favor of the bundled art.

These changes are intentionally **left as an exercise for the reader**: they demonstrate an approach and a few representative fixes rather than an exhaustive, production-hardened port. If you'd like to take it further — full per-monitor DPI awareness, TLS to modern IRC networks, the other client versions — the `*-modern` folders are a good place to start.

### Original build requirements

- Visual C++ 4.x (or compatible NMAKE toolchain)
- MFC 4.x libraries
- Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0
- 486 processor, 8 MB RAM, 256-color video (minimum)

## History

Comic Chat was originally a Microsoft Research project. The 1.0 release shipped in June 1996 bundled with Internet Explorer 3.0 and could run standalone or embedded as an OLE server within the browser. Version 2.0 shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0 and Windows 98 in 1997–1998, adding multi-server support, OLE scripting, and the Comic Chat SDK for third-party bots and extensions. The application was discontinued in the early 2000s as graphical chat gave way to instant messaging.
