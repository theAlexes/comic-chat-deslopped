# Microsoft Comic Chat

Microsoft Comic Chat is a Microsoft-developed internet chat client released in 1996 that transformed traditional text-based conversations into automatically generated comic strips. Instead of plain text, users communicate through cartoon avatars, with messages displayed in speech bubbles inside dynamically created comic panels that conveyed gestures, emotions, and narrative flow. Built as an IRC client and originally a Microsoft Research project, it uses algorithms to mimic comic storytelling techniques, such as panel layout and character expressions, to make online communication more visual and expressive. It was later bundled with Internet Explorer and MSN before being discontinued in the early 2000s.

## How It Works

As users type messages, each Comic Chat client automatically determines:

- Which characters to place in each panel
- Gestures and facial expressions based on message content
- Character placement and orientation
- Word balloon shape, outline, and layout
- When to advance to a new panel
- Zoom factor for each panel

The application connects to standard IRC servers and is fully interoperable with text-based IRC clients. Non-Comic Chat users are automatically assigned characters so the entire conversation is rendered graphically.

## Building

The project targets Win32 (x86) using Visual C++ 4.x with MFC. Build with NMAKE:

```batch
REM Release build (MFC statically linked)
NMAKE /f "chat.mak" CFG="chat - Win32 Release"

REM Debug build (MFC shared DLL)
NMAKE /f "chat.mak" CFG="chat - Win32 Debug"
```

Alternatively, open `chat.mdp` in Visual C++ 4.x.

### Requirements

- Visual C++ 4.x (or compatible NMAKE toolchain)
- MFC 4.x libraries
- Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 (original target)
- 486 processor, 8 MB RAM, 256-color video (minimum)

## History

Comic Chat was released as part of Internet Explorer 3.0 in 1996 and could run standalone or embedded as an OLE server within the browser. It was developed by Microsoft Research and represented a novel approach to graphical chat by applying comics conventions to real-time conversation.
